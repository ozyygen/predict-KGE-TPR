# predict-KGE-TPR
Predicting missing annotations in Gene Ontology with Knowledge Graph Embeddings and True Path Rule
 We propose a method for training Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) that incorporates True Path Rule (TPR) to make the learned embeddings more suitable for inference rules.

 src folder contains all necessary py files for implementing TransE+TPR and generating datasets.
 
 examples folder has several reasoner implementations for different datasets or scenarios.

 We will include the paper's link here soon!
